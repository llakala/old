-- This requires special logic to not break my `fFtT` highlights. Neovim clears
-- hghlights on `zz`, even if the cursor doesn't end up moving. This means that
-- if I run `zz` on every movement, jumping with `f` in the current line will
-- clear the highlights.
--
-- To work around this, I detect whether our cursor is currently centered on the
-- screen, and only run `zz` if it's not. This is more difficult to do than
-- you'd expect - it's trivial if we're in the middle of a buffer and the window
-- height is odd, but the moment that's not true, you need extra logic.
--
-- Naturally, this is a hack, which would be better solved by many changes on
-- the Neovim side, including (but not limited to):
-- 1. Having a more specific CursorMoved autocmd, like CursorMovedV for vertical
-- movement
-- 2. Adding a parameter to the CursorMoved autocmd, which would provide the
-- previous and new cursor position. This would let us take a simple difference
-- for the lnum, and greatly decrease the footprint of this
-- 3. Smarter `zz` highlight clearing, where it doesn't clear highlights if you
-- remain in the same line
--
-- When I'm less swamped, I hope to create a Neovim issue for implementing #3,
-- as I consider it the sanest and easiest solution.
